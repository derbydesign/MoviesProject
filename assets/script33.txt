Friendly Fire
A Screenplay by Zack Doyle

SUSAN is arguing with hopeful hairdresser.
SUSAN tries to hug her but she shakes her off.

SUSAN: Please Maud, don't leave me.
MAUD: I'm sorry Susan, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces her fears head on, instead of running away.
SUSAN: I am such a person!

MAUD frowns.

MAUD: I'm sorry, Susan. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.

MAUD leaves.
SUSAN sits down, looking defeated.

BILL barges in looking flustered, moments later

SUSAN: Goodness, Bill! Is everything okay?
BILL: I'm afraid not.
SUSAN: What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
BILL: It's a lion. I saw an evil lion exterminate a bunch of children!
SUSAN: Defenseless children?
BILL: Yes, defenseless children!
SUSAN: Bloomin' heck, Bill! We've got to do something.
BILL: I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
SUSAN: You can start by telling me where this happened.
BILL: I was...
BILL fans himself and begins to wheeze.

SUSAN: Focus Bill, focus! Where did it happen?
BILL: A Sweet Shop! That's right - A Sweet Shop!

SUSAN springs up and begins to run.

SUSAN rushes along the street.
BILL follows. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.

A wild lion terrorises two children.

SUSAN sees a wild lion terrorizing two children and rushes towards the lion, but suddenly stops in her tracks.

BILL: What is is? What's the matter?
SUSAN: That's not just any old lion, that's Casper Russell!
BILL: Who's Casper Russell?
SUSAN: Who's Casper Russell? Who's Casper Russell? Only the most wild lion in the universe!
BILL: Blinkin' knickers, Susan! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most wild lion in the universe!
SUSAN: You can say that again.
BILL: Blinkin' knickers, Susan! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most wild lion in the universe!
SUSAN: I'm going to need nets, lots of nets.

SUSAN turns toward the lion and speaks as he grins an evil grin.

SUSAN: Casper Russell, we meet again.
BILL: You've met?
SUSAN: Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

THE END
